                  about the child, such as a name or nickname, age or grade and
                  reading level, to create the child’s profile. The Writing

                  collect a persistent identifier or unique ID that allows us to

                  collect the device’s location data, or we may approximate

                  is typically collected through cookies or similar tracking
                  technologies, and we may use third-party providers to collect
                  this information on our behalf. We collect this information to
